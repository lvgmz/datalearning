- thoughtspot sql tutorial - joins: inner join, outer join, left join, right join, full outer join
- joins are used to bring together data between different tables in our queries
- anatomy of a join is after select from some data, JOIN the table we want to add, different join types affects which data is shown in relation to each table, ON a column that relates to each table written table1.samecolumn = table2.samecolumn
- in plain english join all rows from table1 on rows in table2 for which a shared column in table1 is equal to table2
- for join filtering its typically done after the join but if you want to filter before the join you can use the AND statement after ON which evaluates before the join occurs to filter the second table, the WHERE clause after ON filters after the join


- INNER JOIN (also just JOIN) - shows the intersection of two tables, eliminates rows from both tables that don't satisfy ON condition
- outer joins - different kinds left, right and full outer joins that return matched and unmatched values from either or both tables depending on join type
- LEFT JOIN - returns unmatched rows of left table and matched rows of both tables
- RIGHT JOIN - returns unmateched rows of right table and matched rows of both tables
- FULL OUTER JOIN - returns both all unmatched rows and matched rows
