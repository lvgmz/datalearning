- thoughtspot sql subqueries and case statements

- subqueries - used when needing to perform operations step by step, done by writing a query in parenthesis and adding a name for it after and putting that into the parent query usually after the FROM statement, can return single value, list of values or table, use aliases in FROM clause

- CASE - way of handling if/then logic, a CASE statement is followed by a WHEN and THEN pair with an optional ELSE and must end with END, multiple conditions can be added with multiple WHEN THEN pairs and ending with an ELSE statement, CASE always goes in the SELECT clause, creates new column
