- comparison operators can be chained but all requirements must be satisfied
- logical operators: AND, OR, NOT, IN, BETWEEN, LIKE, IS NULL

recap
- AND - used to select rows that satisfy two conditions
- OR - used to select rows that satisfy at least one of two conditions, can be used with AND using parenthesis
- NOT - put before any conditional statement to select rows that are false, often used with LIKE and identifying non NULL rows
- IN - used to specify from a list of comma separated values
- BETWEEN - used to select rows within a specified range, needs to be paired with AND, is inclusive to edge of range
- LIKE - used to match similar values as opposed to exact values, % is used to represent any character or set of characters and is often appended to the start or end of strings, LIKE is case sensitive but ILIKE is not, _ is used to substitute a single character
- IS NULL - lets you exclude rows with missing data from results, IS NOT NULL used to identify non NULL rows
- ORDER BY - used to sort data so results are in order of one or more columns, table is returned in alphabetical ascending order, DESC is added at the end to return in descending order, multiple columns are sorted by the first column and then sorted further if there are equal values by consecutive columns
