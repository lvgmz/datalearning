day 1 - Feb 16, 2026

- started a bit late whoops
- thoughtspot sql tutorial - select, from, limit, where, comparison operators
- these are the basic keywords that make up a simple SQL query, learned these in my databases class
- simple query incorporating all these: SELECT * FROM my_data WHERE size > 5 LIMIT 15

Quick recap
- select chooses colums
    - * returns all
- from chooses table that has these columns
- limit restricts max number of rows returned
- where filters queries
- comparison operators often used with where to aid in filtering, numbers are straight forward words also can be compared but its done alphabetically

- time ~ 25 min
